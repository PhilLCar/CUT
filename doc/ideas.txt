Exception support
Need a solution for intuitive and safe threading
  - "Sync" keyword to autolock code section
  - "Sync" should have a mechanic for sequence, eg sync1 sync2 etc..
  - TBD
Need a solution for intuitive and safe pointers
  - Use moveable pointers, with "take" and "give" operators
  - Same should be used for thread pointers
  - Same should be used for stream pointers
Make all unit tests standardized
  - There should be essentially 4 issues
    - Good output
    - Good output (but memory leak)
    - Wrong output (with or without memory leak)
    - Crash
  We can read popen for the output/memory leak and segfault
